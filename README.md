# TSON
TSON is a YAML-based data format for storing musical tuning and timbre/spectrum data.

This repository contains various tools for working with TSONs, including a [JSON schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spectral-discord/TSON/main/schema/tson.json) and the [TSONify SDKs](https://garden.spectraldiscord.com/#/page/tsonify).
