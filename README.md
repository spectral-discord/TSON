# TSON
TSON is a YAML-based data format for storing musical tuning and timbre/spectrum data.

This repository contains various tools for working with TSONs, including a [JSON schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spectral-discord/TSON/main/schema/tson.json) and the [TSONify SDKs](https://garden.spectraldiscord.com/#/page/tsonify).

### [Check out the Spectral Discord Knowledge Garden for more info and TSON specs!](https://spectral-discord.github.io/knowledge-garden/#/page/tson)

## TSONify
TSONify is a set of open-source SDKs that can be used to include TSON support in software.

So far, only [JavaScript/TypeScript](https://github.com/spectral-discord/TSON/tree/main/typescript) is supported, but other languages are planned!
